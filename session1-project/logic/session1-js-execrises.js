//#9.1 -
//Take the attached excel and create with the values all the products that appear there. U can use either the constructor function or the factory function,
//that you have created earlier. 
// Add them to your products array 


//#9.2
/*
Do a function that searches on your products array the most expensive product and return it.
Constraints:  
- Use Math.max built in function of JS in this function. 
- Print it from outside, not from the function itself â€“ the function should return only value!

Print by any loop that you prefer all the products with the values, and at the end the most expensive. 

for example :

milk : 5
candle: 10
bread : 7

the most expensive product is candle 
*/


//#10
//This function should return only the products of the provided brand from the provided products array. should return array of the product with the
//provided brand. For example getBrandProducts(products, "Tenuva") - should returns only the products of Tenuva
function getBrandProducts(products, brand) {
    //write your code here... 
}
