        <h1>Work Smarter, Not Harder: 10 Ways to Be More Effective at Work</h1>
        <h3>JOHN RAMPTON</h3>
        <p>Regardless of your job or industry, there aren't always enough hours in the day to get everything done.
            As a result, you constantly feel like you're always behind. And that's just <span class="special-text">not good for your productivity
            or your health.</span></p>
        <p>Not necessarily. As Bob Sullivan explained on CNBC.com, "Research that attempts to quantify the relationship
            between hours worked and productivity found that employee output falls sharply after a 50-hour work-week,
            and falls off a cliff after 55 hours -- so much so that <span class = "special-text">someone who puts in 70 hours produces nothing more
            with those extra 15 hours,</span>
            according to a study published last year by John Pencavel of Stanford University."</p>
        <p>Instead of putting in those extra hours, you can become more effective at work by <span class = "special-text">focusing on what really
            matters.</span>
            And you can get started with that ASAP by following these ten simple tips.</p>
