Let's do it private as proper Object should be.

3- Create and Add about 5 products from the excel that reside (=נמצא ) in assests folder, to products array, 
by using the class object you have created above.  call the array "productsMockData" (mock = מזויף, מדומה)

4- SHOW ALL ITEMS 

copy you previos html products page. call it "dynamic-products.html". 
Make a function that makes the html show the products of the array
