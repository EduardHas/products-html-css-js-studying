**Notice - you don't require to make it excatly pixel to pixel, just similar. Don't stop because little things.

We have some parts to the task. 


    LAYOUT
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-website-layout/ - IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK

    2.1 - first - do the global layout - the side bar, the header, the footer..
    Don't insert content to there, just put the element, and do a similar color (ask me about how to check what color there is in this website).


    PRODUCT

    2.2 - Do product element - wrapped by div for showing the products. 
    
    - Take one example from the excel PRODUCTS at the "assests" folder. 

    I am comparing here from the view at amazone to the view should be on the page. Those are the requirments of the element:

    - For the image - put the image you have downloaded, For the name put the name (ברור אבל אומרים גם דברים ברורים).

    - At the place of the stars, put the brand (color of the stars) , and where the numbers are - put the quantity.
    - You have place to the price. Put it there.
    - Under this write: "Not Food" Or "Food" - depend on the product you have choosed. - use simple js as Haim taught you, to affect the dom ( = html) with js.

    Do grid of products 
    Notice that the product should be shown 3 time on each row (currently don't bother your self to handle the responsivity.
    U CAN USE GRID IF YOU WANT (or other pure html elements ). DON'T USE BOOTSTRAP, for now. 

    2.4 - copy the products you have made 12 time. It's should be look similar to the template 

    2.5 - Let's understand together what is box-sizing.
